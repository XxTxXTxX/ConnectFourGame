# ConnectFourGame
The idea comes from famous game ConnectFour, the play method same as connectFour game, the user could choose to play with AI or real player, and every step is read by input :)

Start Guide:
  1. Download all files into same dictionary.
  2. Open Connect game, type:
                            game.setPlayer1(new HumanPlayer('E', board, "Errin"));
                            game.setPlayer2(new AIPlayer('J', board, "James"));
                            game.playGame();
     Where "new HumanPlayer('Sign', board, 'Name')" is creating a new human player, so you and your friend can play together, and don't forget to
     edit 'Sign' and 'Name'. And "new AIPlayer('Sign', board, 'Name')" will create an AI to against you.
  3. Have fun!!!!!!
